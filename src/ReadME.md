###About the project
The project started in the second of october 2023 and hoping to finish it as early as possible from 2/10/2023 to 2/12/2023

The project would execute development as soon as the users or the tester are having problem with the site but if there are no errors or bugs we hope to push it as soon as possible for use.

This project started with one person (Taiwo Akerele a.k.a TaiwoSoftware) and i am hoping to get developers and designers interested in this project but if i don't have any developer on it and it is only me it would just be on github vercel and netlify.

Basically, the project is called dynamics and am using react and check the site for more information.
